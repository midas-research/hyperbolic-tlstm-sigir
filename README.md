### Hyperbolic Online Time Stream Modeling

This repository contains the code for [Hyperbolic Online Time Stream Modeling](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404835.3463119) accepted at SIGIR 2021 and implements the hyperbolic time aware LSTM as well as extends it to a hierarchical hyperbolic RNN model.

Dependencies:

1. PyTorch
2. geoopt==0.1.2

Please follow the [FAST](https://github.com/midas-research/fast-eacl) repository to obtain the data. This code expects data in a pickle format, with separate files for training and testing (dummy data to be uploaded soon!).

To train a model for stock movement prediction or profitability, from "code/", run:

```python
python -W ignore train.py --task movement --data stock(or china) --lr 5e-4 --num_epochs 500 --decay 1e-5 --batch_size 128 --name exp_name
```


To train a model for stock volatility prediction or profitability, from "code/", run:
```python
python -W ignore train.py --task volatility --data stock(or china) --lr 5e-4 --num_epochs 500 --decay 1e-5 --batch_size 128 --name exp_name
```

To calculate the profitability, from "code/", run:
```python
python stock_trade.py --model_path /path/to/model.pth --data stock(or china)
```
